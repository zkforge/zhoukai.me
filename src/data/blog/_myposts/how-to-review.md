> 本文内容均来自于网上搜集到的各种文章及 Review 方法的总结以及一些句式的参考

## 目录

## 审稿方法

### 阅读策略

不同专家采用不同的阅读策略：

**Chris Chambers（卡迪夫大学认知神经科学教授）的方法：**
- 几乎从不打印论文进行审稿；更喜欢使用电子版本
- 按顺序从头到尾阅读论文，在PDF上做注释
- 寻找研究质量的具体指标，自问：
  - 背景文献和研究理由是否清楚表述？
  - 假设是否从前述工作中逻辑推导？
  - 方法是否稳健且控制良好？
  - 报告的分析是否合适？（通常密切关注频率统计学的使用和误用）
  - 结果呈现是否清晰易懂？
  - 讨论部分在多大程度上将发现置于更广泛的背景中，并在解释和有用推测与繁琐废话之间取得平衡？

**Michael Callaham（加州大学旧金山分校急诊护理医师和研究员）的清单方法：**
1. 文章是否写得很好？（通常在方法部分就会显现）
2. 在前几页内是否对假设和背景有好的了解，假设是否有意义或有趣
3. 非常仔细地阅读方法部分
4. 关注结果的说服力和描述的仔细程度
5. 重点检查讨论部分的背景和作者是否提出超出数据的主张

### 审稿记录

**建议的记录方法：**
- 使用电子PDF版本直接做笔记
- 保持打开的文字处理文件，列出"主要项目"和"次要项目"
- 使用荧光笔和其他笔进行标记
- 在额外的纸上做笔记
- 建立个人检查清单，持续问自己问题

### 多轮审阅的重要性

即使对结论很有信心，也要坚持第二天再审阅：
- "我通常在审稿上坐一天，然后重读以确保在决定任何事情之前它是平衡和公平的" - Boatman-Reich
- "我喜欢用两次，即使我对结论很确定。再等一天似乎总是能改善审稿" - Callaham

## 请务必包含在审稿中的内容

### 基本要求

作为审稿的一部分，请确保清楚地证明您对审稿表上每个项目的评分的合理性。

您应该通过详细总结论文来开始评论。这将传达您从论文中理解的内容，可以向作者展示读者错过或解释与作者期望不同的方面。

您可以选择澄清您在多大程度上是（或不是）论文领域的专家（特别是如果审稿表上没有询问这一点）。这可以为您的评论提供一定程度的上下文。

## 需要考虑的方面

这是审阅提交时要查找内容的部分清单。这些项目应该有助于指导您的评估，并为作者形成有用的评论和建议。

### 内容结构评价

- **摘要**：是总结论文、结果和贡献，还是主要激励工作？
- **完整性**：作者是否涵盖了引言中承诺的所有内容？
- **动机**：作者是否提供了足够的动机？
- **背景**：作者是否提供了足够的背景信息？

### 清晰度和表达

- **描述清晰度**：所有描述都清楚吗？
- **图表质量**：表格和数字是否清晰？它们本身才有意义，还是只有在仔细阅读文本的情况下才有意义？
- **数量适中**：图表是否太多？额外的表格或数字会有帮助吗？
- **示例辅助**：（正在运行的）场景或示例会有所帮助吗？

### 研究贡献

- **贡献明确性**：研究贡献是否明确？
- **贡献重要性**：贡献是否重大？
- **方法清晰度**：该方法是否解释清楚且布局良好？
- **论证合理性**：作者是否证明了所提出的每一个观点的合理性？

### 技术质量

- **正确性**：方程、算法、方法、实验和结论是否正确？
- **稳健性**：研究方法是否稳健？
- **全面性**：研究是否全面？
- **合理性**：研究是否合理？

### 文献和理论基础

- **文献基础**：研究是否以文献和适当的理论为基础？
- **引文质量**：作者是否使用重要、最新和充分的引文？
- **引文平衡**：引用太多了吗？有无关紧要或无关紧要的吗？
- **自我引用**：作者自己的作品是否被引用太多？
- **引文建议**：您能提出作者可能忽略的任何缺失引文吗？

### 局限性和结论

- **局限性说明**：作者是否表达了研究的局限性和作者的方法？
- **分析完整性**：作者是否进行了完整的分析并得出了富有洞察力的结论？
- **未来规划**：作者有没有描述他或她未来的研究计划？
- **结论重要性**：结论重要吗？这只是论文的翻版吗？
- **新见解**：它是否提供了新的综合或见解？
- **影响力**：它是否让读者对研究、研究领域或未来感到兴奋？

### 写作风格

- **可读性**：作者的写作风格如何？是不是太"密"了，说不通？
- **兴趣保持**：它能保持读者的兴趣吗？
- **正式程度**：是不是太非正式了？
- **幽默运用**：许多作者在研究论文中非常有效地使用幽默。只有当非正式或幽默妨碍时，才应该不鼓励。
- **学科规范**：某些学科确实强制执行非常正式的写作风格，在这种情况下，非正式的风格被认为是不合适的。

## 是否纠正语法和拼写

校对包括检查正确的语法、正确的拼写以及总体上论文是否"读得很好"。如您所知，拼写检查器既不检查语法也不检查理解。

作者应该对审稿人和编辑有足够的尊重，以提交一篇经过彻底校对的论文。非母语作者有责任确保他们提交的质量符合母语人士提交的质量，即使他们必须花钱请人帮助编辑过程。

然而，作为审稿人，您经常会发现作者忽略的小拼写或语法错误。在所有这些情况下，由您决定编辑论文的程度：
- 您可以决定更正前几页，或反复出现问题的前几个案例
- 如果论文需要进行重大修改，并且您知道更正后的草稿将再次进行审查，您可以建议作者在修改过程中进行此类校对


## 审稿技巧和模板

### 实用审稿技巧

1. **重点关注核心要素**
   - 论文写作质量
   - 创新性
   - 实验设计和结果
   - 文献引用
   - 方法的创新性和实验是最重要的两个部分

2. **提升英语表达**
   - 平时记录地道的英文表达
   - 边读边在PDF上标记觉得好和不好的地方以及原因
   - 写完意见后，用语法检查工具进行校对，然后自己再检查一次确保评审意见没有语法错误

### 审稿决定模板

#### A. 接受 (Accept)

**直接接受：**
```
The authors have made sufficient modifications according to the modification comments, and I suggest that this paper be accepted without further modification.
```

#### B. 拒绝 (Reject)

**标准拒绝模板：**
```
This paper proposes XXX. The work of this paper is clear and logical. However, I have to reject it because of the following problems:

[文法错误] There are so many errors in the manuscript, such as, in page 1, ABSTRACT, XXX would be XXX.

[创新不够] The method of this paper is not innovative enough. In fact, most of the work is done by combining other people's methods. Authors need to highlight their innovative contributions.

[实验不足] Another obvious problem with this paper is the lack of sufficient experimentation to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method. Too few experiments and too many hyperparameters make the conclusion of this paper lack persuasive.
```

#### C. 小修改/大修改 (Minor/Major Changes)

**修改建议模板：**
```
This paper proposes XXX. The work of this paper is practical and logical. However, there are some problems to be further improved as well:

[文法错误] There is at least one Spelling error in the manuscript, such as, in page 7, TABLE I, "Stabalization" would be "Stabilization". Please check the manuscript carefully.

[创新不够] The innovations in this paper focus on novel applications, and the methods and theoretical innovations are not sufficient. The author must dig deeper into the innovation points before the article can be accepted by XXX.

[实验不足] Another obvious problem with this paper is the lack of enough experimentation to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method. The author needs to do more experiments with more angles and show them in this paper.

[文献不足] For the problem of using of video information in the field of transportation, so many methods are proposed, such as, XXX, and, XXX. Perhaps the author can find inspiration by reading more literature in this field to further optimize this paper.
```
